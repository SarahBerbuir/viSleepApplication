Web application of my bachelor thesis "Towards an intuitive visualization of activity, movement, and sleep data.", on which I received a 1.0 from Prof. Doc. Bry.

For the implementation the JavaScript, d3.js and React were utilized.


### Comment about the use of Git during the creation of the project

In this programming project, I deepened my knowledge of Git, but did not yet work with branches. Later, during my internship at BMW, I learned how to use branches. The correct and comprehensive use of commits on other branches is now well known to me and I would now build this project with it. I have created several commits in a previous repository over the period of my bachelor thesis, but this public repository consists of only one commit.


## Abstract from bachelor thesis

This thesis reports on a proof-of-concept novel visualization called _viSleep_ of the physiological data collected with the Oura ring. The visualization approach embedded in a user interface is based on the bubble charts of Hans Rosling. It aims at bringing intuitiveness into the presentation of health data such as activity, movement and sleep data, as these are very complex for human perception. The focus lies on high dimensionality and the parallel presentation of multiple attributes in one view enabling users to interpret and thereby reflect on health data in order to improve health in the long term.  Until now, data visualization was often targeted at experts who do not need to deal intuitively with visualization. The emergence of wearables using physiological data are collected calls for intuitive visualization aimed at non-expert users. Therefore, health data from a wearable was used for implementation and formatting. For the purpose of building an intuitive visualization,the conception and development of the _viSleep_ application was derived through a six-step process adapted from Chittaro, during which the definition of and principles for intuitive use were continuously involved. The visualization should be usable through effectively designed interaction and subconscious utilization of prior knowledge.  In a study, the resulting interactive visualization was evaluated by considering different intuitiveness indicators. This has yielded successful results in terms of the ability to interpret health data effortless and the simultaneous sensation of joy.

## Start-up guide


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
